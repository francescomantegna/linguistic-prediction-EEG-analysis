# linguistic-prediction-EEG-analysis

Many theoretical accounts of prediction in language processing are based to a substantial amount on experimental evidence from electrophysiological studies measuring N400 target word modulations. A drawback of most of these studies is that lexical prediction accounts cannot be distinguished conclusively from (non-prediction) lexical integration (‘bottom-up’ activation) accounts. Here we explored whether it is possible to distinguish integration and prediction accounts of ERP N400 modulations in language processing through experimental design. By employing rhyming sentence completions, we kept ‘word integratability’ constant across conditions that differed in word predictability only.  This experimental design allowed us to attribute N400 target word effects across conditions to predictive language processing. We close by discussing recommendations for future electrophysiological studies on prediction in language.

# Prerequisites

In order to run the code in this repository you need a MATLAB license. Moreover, you need to download the open source MATLAB toolbox FieldTrip (Oostenveld, Fries, Maris, & Schoffelen, 2011). See MATLAB requirements for using FieldTrip here (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/requirements)

# Installing

You can download FieldTrip here http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download. I used the 2017 version to write and test the code.
