# sound-prediction-EEG-analysis

In this experiment, we investigated the pre-activation of sound representations of rhyming final words in spoken sentences-pairs by measuring event-related potentials and time-frequency spectra in order to answer to the following questions: (i) to what extent are phonological representations of upcoming words predicted? (ii) can we detect clear neural correlates of phonological-form prediction? (iii) is there a similar sound-based prediction mechanism in music?

# Prerequisites

In order to run the code in this repository you need a MATLAB license. Moreover, you need to download the open source MATLAB toolbox FieldTrip (Oostenveld, Fries, Maris, & Schoffelen, 2011). See MATLAB requirements for using FieldTrip here (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/requirements)

# Installing

You can download FieldTrip here http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download. I used the 2017 version to write and test the code.
